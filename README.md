## Sanity Studio
I had to run `npx sanity install` in [cms recipe folder](./recipe), otherwise when I was trying to run `npm run start` in that folder it would throw a `Error: No "sanity.json" file found in plugin "@sanity/base"` exception.

This is a CMS for this project.
goto [cms recipe folder](./recipe) folder and run `npm run start`
